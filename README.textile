h2. Install

Using "Composer":https://getcomposer.org:

bc. $ composer require rah/rah_pathway

Or "download":https://github.com/gocom/rah_pathway/releases an installer.

h2. Configure

In Preferences, under *Site* section, *Free-form article URL field* option controls which field is going to be used for the free-form article URL. The assigned field's contents are going to be used as the article URL as-is.

h2. Usage

After you have configured a field to be used as the free-form article URL, you can use it to set any form of URL for articles. Please note that Textpattern and the server must be configured to use clean URLs for this to work.

The URL given to the field can be anything. If you give it @this/is/a/custom/permlink@ as the value, then the article can be found at @https://site.tld/this/is/a/custom/permlink@, where @https://site.tld/@ is your site's address.
